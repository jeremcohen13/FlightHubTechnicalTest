## SWAPI API Project

## Summary

An information websites which allows the user to learn more about their favorite Star Wars characters, Starships and planets. The website also allows you to search for your preferred character and gives a bit of detail on the exact character you were looking for.

## Technologies

The technologies used in this project are : ReactJS, JavaScript and Semantics UI React

### Dependencies

`npm install`

### How to run

`npm start`

### Next Steps

- The next steps to this project would be to add Pagination in order to add more of the data, as the Star Wars story has so much.

- Would also expand the search results so the users are able to search for more information than characters.

- Lastly, would be to add an Autocomplete function for the search bar making the experience more fluid for the user.

### Challenges

- Pagination became a challenge throughout this process, as I had not planned for it in advance a lot of restructuring of my original code would have been required to get it working properly.

- The search results also posed a challenge as I had to restructure how I fetched the information from the API in order to allow the user to properly search for characters.

- The API's loading speed also posed quite an issue as some of the features I had originally intended to include such as Autocomplete in the search bar were not able to function properly.
